  * how it works
  * installation, and platforms
  * GUI, and scripts
  * mod files
* what are the inputs of the project
  * cell model/ cell template
  * electrical measurements ( spike, AHP, FI, input resistance)
* what are the expectations
  * channels conductance optimizations
  * kinetics
* others
    * simplfied cell model ( attached)
